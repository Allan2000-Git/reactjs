# React Router DOM
React Router DOM is a widely used library for managing routing in React applications. It facilitates the creation of single-page applications by handling URL changes and rendering different components based on the current route. This README provides an overview and guidelines for using React Router DOM effectively.

## Installation
To incorporate React Router DOM into your project, use npm or yarn:
    
    ```
    npm install react-router-dom
    # or
    yarn add react-router-dom

## Usage
1. React Router DOM simplifies navigation and view rendering in your React application. Here's a brief guide on how to use it:
2. Router Setup: Begin by wrapping your root component with BrowserRouter to enable routing.
3. Route Configuration: Define your routes using the Route component. Specify the desired path and component for each route.
4. Navigation: Implement navigation between routes using the Link component, ensuring a seamless user experience.
5. Route Parameters: Utilize route parameters to pass dynamic data to components. These parameters can be accessed within the component.
