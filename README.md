# Greeting React App

## How It Works

- The app detects your device's current time zone automatically.
- Using this information, it generates a greeting message tailored to the time of day in your location.
- Whether it's "Good morning," "Good afternoon," or "Good evening," the app ensures your greeting is just right.
