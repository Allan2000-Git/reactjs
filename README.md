# Greeting React App

## How It Works

- The app detects your device's current time zone automatically.
- Using this information, it generates a greeting message tailored to the time of day in your location.
- Whether it's "Good morning," "Good afternoon," or "Good evening," the app ensures your greeting is just right.

## About

Welcome to the React App Name project! This app is designed to [briefly describe the purpose or main features of your app]. It's a great project for React beginners to explore and learn from.

## Prerequisites

Before you get started, make sure you have the following:

1. Node.js: React apps are typically built and run with Node.js. You can download it from the official website: Node.js Downloads.
2. npm or Yarn: Node.js comes with npm (Node Package Manager) by default, but you can also use Yarn as an alternative package manager. You can check if npm is installed by running npm -v and Yarn by running yarn -v. If not, you can install Yarn globally with npm install -g yarn.
3. Code Editor: You'll need a code editor to write and edit React code. Popular choices include Visual Studio Code, Sublime Text, or WebStorm.
4. Git (Optional): While not strictly required, having Git installed can be helpful for version control and collaborating on projects. You can download it from Git Downloads.
5. Browser: You'll need a web browser to run and test your React app. Common choices are Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, or Microsoft Edge.
6. React Development Tools (Browser Extension): These browser extensions help you inspect and debug React components in your app. You can find React DevTools extensions for different browsers in their respective extension stores.
